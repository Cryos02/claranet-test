# clarinet-test
This are the exercises for the selection test.

As I'm a junior developer I still have a lot to learn and experience, this test were of great use to expand my KnowHow.
Yet the time I had was limited by my personal life and I had to make decision to send the requested tasks.

Thanks for the opportunity
